# 🤖 AI-Powered Code Assistant & Analyzer

This project is an all-in-one *intelligent programming assistant* built using open-source tools and models. It allows anyone — from beginners to developers — to easily:
- **Generate code**
- **Fix bugs**
- **Explain existing code**
- **Analyze uploaded programs**

All this is done interactively using a simple *Streamlit web interface* powered by an advanced AI model hosted on *OpenRouter*.

## What Can This Do?

### 1. Chat Code Assistant
You can talk to the AI just like you would with ChatGPT or Copilot and say things like:
- “Write Python code for a calculator”
- “Fix this C++ loop error”
- “Explain what this Java method does”

It responds with actual working code examples in your selected language.

---

### 2. Code File Analyzer
You can upload your existing .py, .js, .cpp, or .java code file and the app will:
- **Explain the code** in human-readable steps
- **Find bugs**
- **Suggest refactoring**
- **Add meaningful comments**

All without needing to write any prompt manually!

---

## Why This Is Useful

- No need to Google “how to fix bug X”
- Makes learning code easier by generating clean, commented examples
- Helps you understand someone else's code
- Works both with text prompts and full files

Whether you're learning programming, debugging an assignment, or exploring codebases at work — this assistant is your smart companion.
